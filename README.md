# 📊 Student Performance Classification

This repository contains a **Machine Learning project** that predicts whether a student will **pass or fail** based on academic, socio-economic, and behavioral factors using tree-based algorithms. The primary models used are **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** classifiers.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

Predicting student performance helps identify learners at risk of failing so that early interventions can be made. This project uses data analysis, preprocessing, and supervised learning to classify students into *Pass* and *Fail* categories based on attributes such as study time, past grades, absences, parental education and more.

## 📊 How It Works

1. **Load Dataset:** Read the CSV data containing student attributes.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualize and analyze feature distributions and correlations.  
3. **Preprocessing:** Encode categorical data, handle missing values, and create the target label (`Pass/Fail`).  
4. **Modeling:** Train machine learning models to classify students.  
5. **Evaluation:** Compare models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.  
6. **Feature Importance:** Identify the most impactful features influencing student success.
